# NU Game Jam 2024! :)
Pong game... or is it?

The game may look like your average pong game but with some purr-fect powerups well suited to the Game Jam's theme of cats, it can make some old school classic more exciting.

## Powerups
These activate only if the ball hits one when they fall down from the screen.

- Red Cat: Gives your bat an extra kick in its next hit.
- Blue Cat: Gives your bat more speed
- Green Cat: Makes your bat longer
- Black Cat: Creates another bat the player can switch to
- White Cat: More balls!

## To do
1. Ball movement
1. Ball collisions
1. Scoring system
1. Powerups!
