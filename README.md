# NU Game Jam 2024! :)
Pong game... or is it?

The game may look like your average pong game but with some purr-fect power-ups well suited to the Game Jam's theme of cats, it can make some old school classic more exciting.

## Power-ups
These activate only if the ball hits one when they fall down from the screen.

- Red Cat: Gives your bat an extra kick in its next hit.
- Blue Cat: Gives your bat more speed
- Green Cat: Makes your bat longer
- Black Cat: Creates another bat the player can switch to
- White Cat: More balls!

## To do
1. Stop flickering
2. Ball can move in any trajectory, rather than one at 45deg
3. Add prompt to top left saying how to exit game (Press ESC)
4. Bat and Ball collisions
5. Scoring system
6. Power-ups!
