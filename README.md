# NU Game Jam 2024! :)
Pong game... or is it?

The game may look like your average pong game but with some purr-fect powerups well suited to the Game Jam's theme of cats.

##Powerups
These activate only if the ball hits one when they fall down from the screen.

- Red Cat: Gives your bat an extra kick in its next hit.
- Blue Cat: Gives your bat more speed
- Green Cat: Makes your bat longer
- Black Cat: Creates another bat the player can switch to
- White Cat: ...

##To do
1. Centralise fonts around a given point
2. Bat movement
3. Ball movement
4. Ball collisions
5. Scoring system
6. Powerups!
