# NU Game Jam 2024! :)
Pong game... or is it?

The game may look like your average pong game but with some purr-fect power-ups well suited to the Game Jam's theme of cats, it can make some old school classic more exciting.

## Power-ups
These activate only if the ball hits one when they fall down from the screen.

- Red Cat: Gives your bat an extra kick in its next hit.
- Blue Cat: Gives your bat more speed
- Green Cat: Makes your bat longer
- Black Cat: Creates another bat the player can switch to
- White Cat: More balls!

## To do
1. Power-ups!
   1. Work on making white cats appear on screen
   2. Then ensure that the disappearing method works
   3. Implement a solution for activating their abilities
   4. Repeat for other cats
2. Ball can move in any trajectory, rather than only at 45deg
3. Screen is a set size, rather than full-screen.
